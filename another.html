      <h2>Lyrics(First Part)</h2>


      <p>
        My new address is hard to remember<br>
        So I wrote it on the back of my hand<br>
        Cause I leave the nest, this coming December<br>
        To make it as a grown man<br>
        I'm about to lose my only defenders<br>
        I'm packing up whatever I can</p>


        <p>
          Been waiting for today but<br>
          All I can think to say is
        </p>


        <p>
          Oh no, don't throw out my Legos<br>
          What if I can't let go<br>
          What if I come back home, back home<br>
          Oh no, don't throw out my Legos<br>
          What if I can't let go<br>
          What if I come back home, back home<br>
          What if I can't let go<br>
          What if I come back home, back home<br>
          Can we keep my Legos at home?<br>
          'Cause I wanna move out<br>
          I don't wanna move on<br>
        </p>
